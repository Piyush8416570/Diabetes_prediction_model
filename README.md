# Diabetes_prediction_model

Hey Coders,

This model is based on Diabetes_prediction of a person through various parameters.
Basically, this model used KNN, SVM, Naives bayes algorithm in making this possible with good accuracy count.

To run this stuff, follow this-
1. simply run my app.py firstly on any navigator, or even on any ide.
2.afterwards leave all the process on the model.

so, go for it and explore it.
Thanks you.
